 What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
 What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
 If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?

Create a README.md text file that explains your project. This file should include your Project
title, and a description of your project. 

Your README.md file should be minimally multiple paragraphs in length, and should explain
what your project is, what each of the files you wrote for the project contains and does, and if
you debated certain design choices, explaining why you made them. Ensure you allocate
sufficient time and energy to writing a README.md that documents your project thoroughly.
